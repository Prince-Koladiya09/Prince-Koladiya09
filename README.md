Featured Projects ðŸ’¡
IMDB Sentiment Analysis: Baseline to Transformers
Tools: Python (TensorFlow, Keras, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, LIME)

Engineered a comprehensive 10-step machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews, demonstrating end-to-end ML development proficiency.

Benchmarked performance by implementing and comparing traditional models (TF-IDF with Naive Bayes, GridSearchCV-tuned Logistic Regression) against advanced deep learning architectures.

Developed and trained an RNN (Bidirectional LSTM) model, significantly improving sequence understanding and prediction accuracy over baselines.

Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy by fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer model (DistilBERT), showcasing expertise in leveraging cutting-edge NLP techniques.

Conducted robust model evaluation using diverse metrics and confusion matrices, providing clear insights into model strengths and weaknesses.

Utilized LIME for model interpretability and performed qualitative error analysis, enhancing transparency and debugging capabilities for complex AI systems.
